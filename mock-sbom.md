# Mock SBoM Document

To facilitate prototyping workflows, we will prototype an SBoM document.

We realize there are several SBoM efforts underway. If there is a particular SBoM document that we can use, we're happy to move to something more realistic.

For the time being, we'll use [mock-sbom.json](./mock-sbom.json)

```json
{
    "author": "john doe",
    "createdDate": "6/24/2020 10:10:20",
    "packages": [
        "foo.npm",
        "bar.npm"
    ]
}
```
